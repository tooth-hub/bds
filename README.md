# Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server

Bedrock Dedicated Servers allow Minecraft players on Windows and Linux computers to set up their own server at home, or host their server using a cloud-based service. This is in its early development stages, so as with any early release software, it may have severe issues. Due to this, support may be stopped at any time.
